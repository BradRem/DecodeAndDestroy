<h2>About Decode and Destroy</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    <i>Decode and Destroy</i> is a service that temporily stores encrypted messages that can only be retrieved by an
    individual that is given the proper website link.  Once the message is retrieved the first time, it will be deleted
    and no longer be available from subsequent attempts.  If the message is not retrieved within 24 hours, it will
    be automatically deleted.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    Messages are automatically encoded with the Rijndael encryption algorithm using a random key and stored in the
    Decode and Destroy database.  The key is provided in the website link and is not stored by Decode and Destroy
    so we do not have access to the plaintext contents of the message.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    A user simply clicks on the link created by Decode and Destroy where he/she will be able to easily retrieve
    the message.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
    Optionally, a user can specify a strong password that can be used as the key to encrypt the message. When a
    password is used, the recepient of the message will be prompted to enter the password after he/she clicks
    on the website link.  As with the automatically generated key, we do not record the password and do not
    have access to the contents of the plaintext message.
